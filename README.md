# JM0140-M-6: Individual Data Mining Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline to classify arthritis types in adults using the NHANES dataset, leveraging socio-demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data. The goal is to identify significant predictors, evaluate model performance, and advance arthritis subtype detection to improve early diagnosis and patient care.
